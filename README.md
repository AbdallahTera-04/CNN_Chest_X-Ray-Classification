### 📘 README.md — Pneumonia Detection using CNN

#### 🧠 Project Overview

This project builds a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify chest X-ray images as either **Normal** or **Pneumonia**. It includes data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation. The dataset is sourced via Kaggle and processed using TensorFlow/Keras.

---

#### 📁 Project Structure

1. **# Loading Dataset**

   * Uses Kaggle API to download chest X-ray images dataset.
   * Organizes data into train/validation/test directories.

2. **# Importing Libraries and Directory Setup**

   * Imports required Python libraries like `tensorflow`, `os`, `numpy`, and visualization tools like `matplotlib`.

3. **# Data Generators**

   * Applies preprocessing like rescaling and data augmentation using `ImageDataGenerator`.

4. **# Building the CNN**

   * Defines a custom CNN architecture for binary image classification.

5. **# Model Compilation**

   * Compiles the CNN model using optimizer (Adam), binary crossentropy loss, and accuracy metric.

6. **# Callbacks**

   * Implements callbacks such as `EarlyStopping` and `ModelCheckpoint`.

7. **# Train**

   * Trains the model using the training and validation sets.

8. **# Evaluate Test Set**

   * Evaluates model performance on the test dataset.

9. **# Plotting**

   * Visualizes accuracy and loss trends over training epochs.

#### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib kaggle
   ```

2. **Authenticate Kaggle API**

   * Upload your `kaggle.json` credentials file into your environment (e.g., Google Colab).
   * Set permissions and download the dataset.

3. **Run the Notebook**

   * Execute cells sequentially from top to bottom.

---

#### 📊 Outputs

* Trained CNN model.
* Accuracy and loss plots.
* Final evaluation metrics on the test set.

---

#### 📎 Notes

* You can customize the CNN layers or try transfer learning (e.g., VGG16, ResNet).
* Recommended to monitor for overfitting with validation curves and callbacks.
